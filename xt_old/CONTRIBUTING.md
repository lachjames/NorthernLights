We welcome and value contributions, but please have a look at the [Developer's Central page in our wiki](https://wiki.xoreos.org/index.php?title=Developer_Central) before contributing to ensure you are aware of our commit guidelines and coding style, and read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Pull requests and patches will be finely checked for proper adherence to our guidelines and we will expect you to fix any and all deviations before the changes are merged into the official repository. This is by no means meant personally or an indication of reluctance with accepting your changes.

If you wish to make further long-term contributions to xoreos, we will gladly accept you as a team member and give you direct push access to the repository after we have made sure you can follow our guidelines on your own.
